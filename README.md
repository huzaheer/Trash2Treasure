## **Overview**

![App Logo](/gallery.jpg)

Trash2Treasure (T2T) is a student-led initiative intended to incentivize waste reduction and enrich recycling efforts within Duke University’s West Campus dormitories. T2T encourages individuals to actively participate in Duke’s sustainability initiatives by offering small incentives as rewards for the dorms (and residents) who are the most successful in achieving their environmental goals. T2T is operated through this webpage, which, along with a fully-functioning database and API, was created fully from scratch by our team.

## **Scoring**

Scoring is based off of the following model: 

Points (per individual) = (# of cardboard containers recycled) + 2 * (# of bottles recycled) + 2 * (# of cans recycled)

![Form](/gallery_5.jpg)

Scores will reset every two weeks, and one the last day of each two-week period, the scores among dorms will be tallied. The dorms with the most points per resident (total points within the dorm / no. of residents, as some dorms have more people than others) will retain their points, which can be exchanged for rewards such as extra food points, parking passes, and coupons/vouchers/gift cards for on-campus stores.

2 real-time leaderboards will display the recycling rankings of all seven dormitories as well as the user point leaders throughout all of West Campus. This program is meant to encourage healthy competition among quads while also raising awareness for sustainable practices.

## **How we built it**

For the tech stack, we used React.js for the front-end, Ruby on Rails for the backend, MySQL as our database, and Docker as the container.

## **Future Considerations**

Future considerations include integrating Duke NetID Login, increasing verification and punitive measures, and expanding to East Campus/Swift.
